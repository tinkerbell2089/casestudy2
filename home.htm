         <p>
            <span>Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. 
            such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on 
            rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. 
            I have gotten so many enthusiastic comments about the wonderful 
            performances that I've started putting up a 
            <a href="slide1.htm"> slide show</a>
            of the production. Please feel free to download the files from 
            the Web site. If you want high resolution photo files, please 
            <a href="mailto:tashajur@lakewood.edu?subject=Digital%20Photo">contact me</a>.
